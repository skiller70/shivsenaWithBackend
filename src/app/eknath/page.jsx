          Since his youth days, Shinde was inspired by the ideology of Balasaheb Thackeray. He entered politics in the 1980s when he joined Shiv Sena as a Sainik, introduced by Anand Dighe, his mentor and a senior leader in the party. Shinde, under Dighes leadership, emerged as a street-smart leader and problem solver. He participated in various agitations, including the Maharashtra-Karnataka border agitation when he was arrested and imprisoned for 40 days.

          His rise surprised many because of his enthusiasm, dedication, and preparedness to convert a crisis into an opportunity. Dighe was impressed by Shindes work and brought him into electoral politics by giving him a party ticket in 1997.
